# Text-Based-Spiral-Animation-in-Python

🚀 Overview
# This Python script generates a text-based animated spiral pattern using basic loops and print statements. It doesn't require any external libraries, making it compatible with any online Python compiler or local environment. The animation is created using simple text characters (*), and the spiral grows dynamically over time.

🎯 Features
✅ Text-Based Animation: Creates a visually appealing spiral animation using only text characters.
✅ No External Libraries: Uses only built-in Python modules (time), making it lightweight and easy to run.
✅ Customizable: Adjust the size and delay variables to control the size of the spiral and the speed of the animation.
✅ Compatible Everywhere: Works in any online Python compiler or local environment.

🛠️ Installation
