# Text-Based-Spiral-Animation-in-Python

# üöÄ Overview
# This Python script generates a text-based animated spiral pattern using basic loops and print statements.
# It doesn't require any external libraries, making it compatible with any online Python compiler or local environment.
# The animation is created using simple text characters (*), and the spiral grows dynamically over time.

# üéØ Features
# ‚úÖ Text-Based Animation: Creates a visually appealing spiral animation using only text characters.
# ‚úÖ No External Libraries: Uses only built-in Python modules (time), making it lightweight and easy to run.
# ‚úÖ Customizable: Adjust the size and delay variables to control the size of the spiral and the speed of the animation.
# ‚úÖ Compatible Everywhere: Works in any online Python compiler or local environment.

# üõ†Ô∏è Installation
# Clone this repository to your local machine or copy the script directly.


# git clone https://github.com/your-username/text-based-spiral-animation.git
# cd text-based-spiral-animation
# Run the script in a Python environment:
